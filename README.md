### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Emmanuel Sibanda, a Zimbabwean born Full Stack Developer and Entrepreneur.

I love building side-projects to solve problems I deeply resonate with specifically in the EdTech Space.

*Currently* 
Building a pair programming platform help people prepare for technical interviews. You hop on my platform, get matched with a peer and collaboratively solve a timed challenge, helping you develop both your problem solving and communication skills. I regularly schedule pair programming sessions to get a better understanding of how to perfect this process.

If you are looking to schedule a pair programming session with me: https://calendly.com/peerprogramming/1hr
Want to check out my project and collaborate?: https://github.com/EmmS21/peerprogrammingplatform. 

**Programming Languages**
I am generally more competent with JavaScript and Python. When it comes to frameworks; React, Vue, Django, Flask and Shiny

Also: R, SQL, HTML and CSS

**Prior Experience**
I have a law background (*prepares overly complex words to explain very basic concepts to sound smarter and more intimidating*). I previously worked as a Data Analyst/BI Analyst (*takes out calculator*) for a large AdTech as an intern, a Venture Capital Firm, a bank as a contractor and at a high growth fintech in South Africa. My interest in moving more towards code/towards Software Development came from realizing that I really, really enjoy the process of struggling along to build a side project. Each challenge I encountered made me more excited about waking up the next day to write code, which was the main reason for my career transition.

**What else do I do?**
I box, I love jiu jitsu, I workout regularly, considering getting into Ballet and Salsa and, learning how to swim (*water scares me- so this is a fear I need to get over*), always enjoy a good chess game, learning new skills and trying new outdoor activities.

**Do I have a portfolio?**
Yeah: https://emms21.github.io/User-Interface-II/
