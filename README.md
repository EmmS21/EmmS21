### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Emmanuel Sibanda, a Zimbabwean born Full Stack Developer and Entrepreneur.

I love building side-projects to solve problems I deeply resonate with specifically in the EdTech Space.

**Programming Languages**
JavaScript, Python, R, NodeJS

**Frameworks and tools**
Docker, Django, React, Flask, Shiny, SKLearn

**Prior Experience**
I have a law background. I previously worked as a Data Analyst/BI Analystfor a large AdTech as an intern, a Venture Capital Firm, a bank as a contractor and at a high growth fintech in South Africa. My interest in moving more towards code/towards Software Development came from realizing that I really, really enjoy the process of struggling along to build a side project. Each challenge I encountered made me more excited about waking up the next day to write code, which was the main reason for my career transition.

**What else do I do?**
Boxing, Jiu Jitsu, Gym, Chess

**Do I have a portfolio?**
Yeah: [https://emms21.github.io/User-Interface-II/](https://emmanuelsibanda.vercel.app/)
