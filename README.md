### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Emmanuel Sibanda, a Zimbabwean born Full Stack Developer and Entrrepreneur.

I love building side-projects to solve problems I deeply resonate with specifically in the EdTech Space.

I am currently building a pair programming platform help people prepare for technical interviews. You hop on my platform, get matched with a peer and collaboratively solve a timed challenge, helping you develop both your problem solving and communication skills. I regularly schedule pair programming sessions to get a better understanding of how to perfect this process.

If you are looking to schedule a pair programming session with me: https://calendly.com/peerprogramming/1hr

**Programming Languages**
To be honest, I can't say I love one programming language over the other, I am generally a lot more competent with JavaScript and Python. When it comes to frameworks; React, Vue and Django

**Prior Experience**
I previously worked with data (takes out calculator). My interest in moving more towards code/towards Software Development came from realizing that I really, really enjoy the process of struggling along to build a side project. Each challenge I encountered made me more excited about waking up the next day to write code. This was the main reason for my career transition.

**What else do I do?**
I box, I love jiu jitsu, I workout regularly, I am learning how to swim and always enjoy a good chess game
